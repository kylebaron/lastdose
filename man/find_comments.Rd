\description{
This function uses specific criteria for finding comment records that may
not match up with your coding conventions.  See details below as well as
unit tests.
}
\details{
For the data frame method, comments are found in a column with name \code{C}
with type \code{character}.  If a \code{C} column is found that is not character,
a warning is generated and no comments are found.

For the character method or when an appropriate \code{C} column is found when
using the data frame method, a position or row is considered a comment
when it is either \code{NA} or when it is equal to \code{.}.
}
\examples{
comment <- c(NA, "C", "C", NA, ".", NA, "Comment")
dv <- rnorm(length(comment))
df <- data.frame(C = comment , DV = dv)

find_comments(df)

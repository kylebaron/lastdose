LSD-S001:
  name: Add TAD and LDOS to data set
  description: The user will pass in NMTRAN-formatted analysis data as a data frame,
    with required numeric columns 'ID', 'TIME', 'AMT', 'EVID', and optional columns
    'ADDL', and 'II' (lower case is accepted too). The input data set must be sorted
    by time within individual; an error is generated otherwise.

LSD-S002:
  name: Return TAD and LDOS in different formats
  description: The `lastdose()` function will append columns called `TAD` and `LDOS`
    to the input data indicating the time after dose and last dose, respectively.
    `lastdose_list()`and `lastdose_df()` functions will return a named list or dataframe
    with columns `tad` and `ldos` respectively.

LSD-S003:
  name: Choose how TAD and LDOS are filled
  description: By default, doses prior to the first dosing record will be calculated
    as time before the first dose and be expressed as negative numbers. The user may
    optionally choose to fill in `TAD` for records prior to the first dose with a
    single user-specified fill value.

LSD-S004:
  name: Commented dose records are ignored when finding doses
  description: By default, comments are found when the data frame has a column called
    `C`and it is character; rows are commented if `C` is not NA and not equal to `.`.
    Other use cases are available as well, such as passing a logical vector of rows
    to be considered as comments.

LSD-S006:
  name: Undefined behavior when checking ADDL and II
  description: When either ADDL or II are not found in the data set, lastdose continues
    to check for missing values, resulting in undefined behavior. The solution is
    to drop `has_addl` checks and/or pass in vectors of all zeros for ADDL and II
    when they are missing.
